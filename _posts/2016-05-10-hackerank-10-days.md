# Hackerank - 10 Days

## Familiar and Forgotten

I always have this issue with the classic web languages, that they're constantly familiar, and yet just out of grasp. In work and general tooling about on the internet I am always popping open the inspector and taking a look under the hood. I'm normally sharp enough with CSS3, as I've also made a number of sites since I stopped getting paid for doing so, and I'm a fan of what I've seen of Node...

But Javascript was never 2nd nature for me

As much as my web work may go on (in and out of the office), I always have to Google whenever I start coding.

And that's where the [30 days of Code Hackerrank][0] challenge came into things. I was considering the last time I felt empowered by my ability to code. And I mean properly empowered... Where you feeling like you're a wizard rather than working! And that was probably bash scripting in 2012\. That's a long time ago. I'd played around with a bunch of languages and learning tools like Hackerrank in the past, with comprehension or a particular task in mind. [Code Academy][1] was great for _"Hello World"_ and beyond, and for learning Python, [Checkio][2] is fantastic.

But, with none of my learning had I ever been intending to get empowered by technology again.

So with a new mindset, I've had 10 days back in Javascript with Hackerrank, and I've loved what I've done. As always, there have been lows and highs. It took several hours and a few questions to my girlfriend before I got what the point of Maps were... Turns out they're useful!

But then I was really impressed with myself with this Hourglass challenge. Given a 6 x 6 grid of numbers in a 2d array, you had to calculate the maximum value a "shape" had in the array. I had given myself a lunch hour for the task, but my submission was uploaded and working in under 20 minutes! That's night and day compared to the basic operations I was doing before, and I had no question requiring a search engine or code book. I knew all the skills already.

So. On the whole its been fun and rewarding. As Hackerrank are keen to point out, a little every day does help. And when it comes to Javascript - whether we love it or hate it -- its not going anywhere anytime soon.
