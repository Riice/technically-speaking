<h2>The Club</h2><p>Housed in by lake Zurich in small club called rote fabrik (named after the red bricked buildings adorned with inventive arty graffiti that were once factories) Incidentally a great place to see bands and celebrate something of an alternate, anti-capitalist living.</p><picture>

<ul><li>Snowy Winter</li></ul><p>The building was cold, in the heart of winter with the winds January's season blasting at the windows and down the concrete streets outside. Well… it wasn't so much cold as frigid and deathly. I've never worn jacket jumpers and gloves to code, but this was a necessity.</p><p>I've never worn jacket jumpers and gloves to code, but this was a necessity.</p><p>But stepping outside to see the snow fall with a quick cigarette break from my girlfriend was a special reminder of nature's beauty, and that there was a world outside for us when this was all over.</p><h2>Our Plans</h2><p>Initially, with a team of 4 we had decided for endorsing a huge winding narrative with many separate scenes. We'd liked the idea that stressing one word in the sentence changed its meaning, and felt that worked for an adventure puzzle experience. Something like Myst perhaps? </p><p>Each of us would dive into a scene from life, and using Unity we'd build up each scene, with several different routes possible throughout. My partner had downloaded a set of cool chiptunes (songs made on low fi games consoles like <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFoKGo0LwlM">this</a></i>), and we guessed this would be relevant somehow…</p><p>But time was of the essence, so we needed to ensure we crack on and get things done.</p><p>With a reasonable background in 3d modelling from back at school - making mini animations and graphics - plus working on similar tools while developing educational material for other colleges at uni.</p><p>I was a little over ambitious for my skill level… But I wasn't put off. I conceived and started rendering in chunky 3d all manner of bedroom furniture, and got carried away with generating a responsive physics based fabric for the bedroom.</p><p>I also started to work on a game within a game that could be controlled etcher sketch like a pair of dials… I think it was a block breaker game if memory serves.</p><p>Oh, and while learning C# during the proceedings was no issue for my partner, she couldn't get a hang of making a GUI.</p><h2>The Reality</h2><p>48 hours isn't much time to learn how to do something, while teaching others and all pulling in different directions. One guy made a fantastic rendition of the room we were in using his cameras and Photoshop as well as the assets he downloaded to make a row of houses by a family garden.</p><picture>

<p>Another team mate was rather proud of the chair she made - her first foray into graphic design, let alone game design. </p><p>And I was feeling a bit underwhelmed by the room of grey, texture free bedroom I'd created, even if you could throw the toys around and watch them glide happily into the toy box….</p><p>The block breaker game didn't make the cut, as adding gravity seemed to cause some unexpected problems. Then burn out set in leading to delirium… I'd saved the nectar of coffee until the morning of the 2nd day, which gave us a burst. Oh, and pizzas from our team mate in the evening were a magic revitaliser!</p><p>But even though I took a couple of hours sleep the 2nd evening, I couldn't convince my partner… When I awoke, creaking and cold, she was still sat on her steel chair having concocted an unearthly naming convention. We can't remember all the variable names now, but there were more #s és and xs then are normally sane </p><p>So the final 8 hours turned out to be us just trying to slam together 4 different Unity projects, each with a few scenes and gigs of assets. </p><p>Once it was all squeezed together, the next challenge was condensing it into a size that would be possible to submit for consideration and <cough> award consideration. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there were no ribbons and fanfare for our team. But we did manage to submit it, and I was very proud to have a Microsoft Games evangelist compliment us on making a 3D title.</cough></p><p>Maybe the nicer lesson and challenge from the whole thing, was still the initial question:</p><p><i>With skies clear and a blue ocean ahead of us, </i></p><blockquote><p>What do we do now?</p></blockquote><p><i></i></p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><h2 data-reactid="29"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="30">Game Jam - Zurich 2015</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="33"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
